<h2>Upgrade Instructions of Open eClass 2.3</h2>
<h3>The Upgrade Process </h3>
<p>The new Open eClass version 2.3 retains backward compatibility (with previous versions). For that reason, you can upgrade an already installed platform from prior versions (1.7, 2.0, 2.1.x, 2.2) to the current 2.3 easily and quickly, following the upgrade instructions provided below. Keeping a safety record of the course contents and the database before beginning to upgrade is recommended.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><b>WARNING!</b>
<ul>
<li>Please ensure that during the platform's upgrade process there is no access to Open eClass courses by the platform's users and the platform's database is not accessible by anyone  
</li>
<li>Also check the platform's version that is already installed in your server, by following the link 'Platform's Information' in the home page. In order to the upgrade process to be possible the already installed platform should be either version >=1.7. For previous versions (1.5, 1.6) you need to upgrade first in 1.7 following the instructions at the last section of this manual 'Upgrade to Open eClass 2.2 from older versions 1.5, 1.6'.
</li>
<li>
Before the upgrade procedure please backup both the eCourses files and the platform's Database.
</li>
</ul>
Then, follow the steps below.

<h3>1st Step: Upgrading in Unix / Linux computers</h3>
</a>
<p>All operations presuppose you have the administrator's rights (root) on your computer.</p>
<p>The following example presumes that the eClass platform is already installed on directory <code>/var/www/html</code>.</p>
<p>Due to some changes included by the new (2.3) Open eClass version you will have to delete the old and install the new one. To make sure that you old configuration remain intact you must do the following actions:</p>
<p>We consider that you have downloaded <b>openeclass-2.2.tar.gz</b> on the <code>/tmp
  </code> directory. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Go to the directory you have installed in eClass. e.g.
    <pre>cd /var/www/html</pre>
  <li> Move the configuration file (<em>eclass/config/config.php</em>)
    in another temporary directory (e.g. to directory <em>/tmp</em>)
        <pre>mv /var/www/html/eclass/config/config.php /tmp</pre>
  </li>
  <li>If you have courses in which you have used subsystem 'Chat' then move the appropriate chat files as well.
    These are found in directory eclass/modules/chat/ with the form course_code.chat.txt
    e.g.
    <pre>mv /var/www/html/eclass/modules/chat/*.txt /tmp</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Delete all the directories except courses and config
     e.g.
    <pre>cd /var/www/html/eclass/
rm -rf images/ include/ info/ install/ manuals/ template/ modules/ </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Untar openeclass-2.3.tar.gz in a temporary directory (/tmp) e.g.
    <pre>tar xzvf /tmp/openeclass-2.2.tar.gz</pre>

	Then copy from the temporary directory /tmp/openeclass21 all of its contents in the installation directory e.g.
	<pre>cp -a /tmp/openeclass22/*  /var/www/html/eclass/</pre>
	
	So with the above steps you have replaced directory eclass, with the new one.
  </li>
  <li>Then move file <em>config.php</em> to directory <em>config</em>.
    e.g.
    <pre>mv /tmp/config.php /var/www/html/eclass/config/</pre>
  <li>Move to the original place the chat files. e.g.
    <pre>mv /tmp/*.txt /var/www/html/eclass/modules/chat/</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Correct (if necessary) the files and sub-directories permissions: (supposing that the apache is running as www-data) 

    <pre>cd /opt/eclass
chown -R www-data *
find ./ -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;
find ./ -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Having completed the previous steps, you will have installed the new eClass version (eClass 2.3) files successfully. Then, move on to  <a href="#dbase">the second step</a> in order to upgrade the platform databases.</p>

<h3><a name="win">1st Step: Upgrading in Ms Windows Computers</a></h3>
<p>The following example presupposes that eClass has already been installed to directory <code>C:\Program Files\Apache\htdocs\</code> and that you have downloaded <b>openeclass-2.3.zip</b>.</p>  
<p>Due to several changes included by the new (2.3) Open eClass version you will have to delete the old and install the new one. To make sure that you old configuration remain intact you must do the following actions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Move to the eClass installed folder. e.g.<code>C:\Program
    Files\Apache\htdocs</code></li>
  <li>Move the configuration file (<code>C:\Program Files\Apache\htdocs\eclass\config\config.php</code>)
    in another temporary folder in your desktop (e.g. from <code>C:\Program
    Files\Apache\htdocs\eclass\config\</code> to folder <code>C:\Documents
    and Settings\Administrator\Desktop\</code></li>)
  <li>If you have courses in which you have used subsystem 'Chat' then move the appropriate chat files as well.
    These are found in folder <code>C:\Program Files\Apache\htdocs\eclass\modules\chat\</code> with the form course_code.chat.txt 
  </li>
  <li>Go to eclass folder (e.g.<code>C:\Program Files\Apache\htdocs\eclass\</code>) and delete all the folders except courses and config.</li>
  <li>Unzip openeclass-2.3.zip to a temporary folder on the desktop. e.g.
    <code>C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop\eclass17</code>.
	After that rename the temporary folder eclass21 to eclass and copy it along with its contents (files and documents). Then, open the file that includes eClass installation, e.g. 
 <code>C:\Program
    Files\Apache\htdocs\</code> 
	and paste it. In that way, the eclass files is replaced by the new ones. 
  </li>
  <li>Move to the original place the chat files. e.g. in <code>C:\Program Files\Apache\htdocs\eclass\modules\chat\</code></li>
  <li>Delete the desktop temporary folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>As soon as the above have been completed, you will have installed the new eClass version files (eClass 2.3) successfully. Then, follow the  <a href="#dbase">second step</a> so as to upgrade the platform database.
</p>

<a name="dbase">
<h3>2nd Step: Database Upgrade</h3>
</a>
<div class="note">
<p>Before running the database upgrade script, make sure that MySQL is not operating in strict mode. In order to establish that, check if the parameter <pre>--sql-mode</pre> (in file <em>my.cnf</em> Î® <em>my.ini</em> for UNIX / Windows correspondingly) has been set. If it is set (e.g. <code>--sql-mode=STRICT_TRANS_TABLES</code>
    or <code>--sql-mode=STRICT_ALL_TABLES</code>) then you need to modify it to null (<code>--sql-mode=""</code>).
    </p>
</div>
<div class="note">
  <p><b>For Unix/Linux systems only: </b>The process of platform database upgrade includes changes on the <em> config.php</em>. As a result, you will temporarily need to change your access rights on the <em>config.php</em> file and the /config directory into read-write (chmod 664).
  </div>
<p>Then keystroke the following URL on your browser:</p>
<code>http://(url of eclass)/upgrade/</code>
<p>You will be prompted for the username and password of the platform administrator. After providing your personal details, you will be asked to change/correct contact details, as well as students' registration mode on the platform (free or applied registration). The database upgrade will begin afterwards. You will see several messages concerning your working progress. Probably you will not see any false messages. Note that depending on the number and content of courses, it is possible that the process will last for a long time. 
</p>
<p>In the opposite case (namely if error messages occur), then it is possible for a course not to be operating properly. Such error messages may occur if you have altered the structure of an eclass database table. Note (if possible) the accurate error message you saw.</p>
<p>If you face any problems with any course after the upgrade, contact us (eclass@gunet.gr). (<a href="mailto:admin@openeclass.org">admin@openeclass.org</a>).</p>
<a name="after">
<h3>3rd Step: Successful Upgrade Check</h3>
</a>
<p>In order to make sure that the platform has been upgraded, login as administrator and click to "Admin tools". Among other things, version 2.3 has to be indicated. You can alternatively click on the "Platform Information" link on the homepage. Version 2.3 of the platform will be indicated.

<p>You are ready! The upgrade process has been completed successfully. </p>
<p>If you want to see the new features of the new version, go to <a href="CHANGES_en.txt">CHANGES.txt</a> text file. Read forward for further additional regulations (HTTPS, Latex etc).</p>

<a name="other">
<h3>Optional Further Configurations</h3>
</a>
<ul>
<li>In the <em>config.php</em> file, the <em>close_user_registration</em> variable, which is FALSE by definition, will be defined. Changing the value to <em>TRUE</em>, registration of users with 'student' rights will not be free anymore. Users will have to follow a process similar to the teacher account creation process, namely filling in a student account application form, in order to obtain a platform account. The application will be examined by the administrator who either approves of it and opens an account, or rejects it.  
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to modify any message of platform then proceed with the following actions:
Create a file of type .php with name <em>english.inc.php</em> (or <em>greek.inc.php</em>) and place it in directory <em>(eclass path)/config/</em>. Find the varible name which contains the message you wish to change and assing it the new message. e.g. If you want to change message <pre>$langAboutText = "The platform version is";</pre> create <em>english.inc.php</em> in directory (eclass path)/config/ like this:
<pre>
&lt;?
$langAboutText = "Version is";
?&gt;
</pre>
With the above way, you preserve custom messages from future upgrades of platform.
<p>
<p>
 You can modify the names of the basic roles of the users of the platform by modifying the message file (eClass_path)/modules/lang/greek/common.inc.php
</p>
<p>
You can add a text (e.g. informative) on the left and right of the platform homepage. For that reason, assign the value - message in variables <em>$langExtrasLeft</em> ÎºÎ±Î¹ <em>$langExtrasRight</em>, correspondingly in file <em>(path ÏÎ¿Ï eClass)/modules/lang/greek/common.inc.php</em> 
</p>
</li>
<li>Open eClass supports mathematical symbols in subsystems "Exercises", "Forums" and "Announcements". In "Exercises" you can add math symbols in fields "Exercise Description" while a new exercise is created (or modified), in field "Comment" when a new question in an exercise is created (or modified). In subsystem "Forums" when you compose a new message or reply to an existing one and in subsystem "Announcements" when a new announcement is created. Math symbols must be enclosed with tags <em>&lt;m&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;/m&gt;</em>.
E.g. when you type 
<pre>
&lt;m&gt;sqrt{x-1}&lt;/m&gt; 
</pre>
square root of x-1 will be drawed. For syntax of all mathematical symbols, read manual in <em>http://(Open eClass url)/manuals/PhpMathPublisherHelp.pdf</em>
<li>
If you want to use the platform with a Web server which has the SSL support activated (e.g. https://eclass.gunet.gr), you can do it by defining the <em>urlSecure</em> variable on <em>config.php</em>. e.g.<code>$urlSecure = "https://eclass.gunet.gr"</code> 
    </li>
You will find more and further information for these actions in the Administratior's manual (included in the management tool). 
</ul>
<h3>Upgrading from Older Versions (1.5,  1.6) </h3>
<p>For upgrading from older versions 1.5, 1.6 you have to do some changes manually. Starting from the course directories is now stored in a new directory named <em>courses</em>. Also the configurations file location (<code>config.php</code>) has changed, and is now included in a new directory named <em>config</em>. So, in order not to lose your previous configuration and all your eCourses files, please follow the instructions below.
