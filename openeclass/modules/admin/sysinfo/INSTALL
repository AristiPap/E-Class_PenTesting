Installing phpSysInfo:
----------------------

Just decompress and untar the source (which you should have done by now, if
you're reading this...), into your webserver's document root.

Then make sure your 'php.ini' file's include_path entry contains ".".

...and that's it.  Restart your webserver (if you changed php.ini), and viola!

Please keep in the mind that because phpSysInfo requires access to many files
in /proc and other system binary you MUST DISABLE php's safe_mode.  Please see
the PHP documentation for information on how you can do this.

if you wish to see the i18n support either edit the index.php and change
the default language or add ?lng=es or ?lng=fr to your URL..
(ie. http://phpsysinfo.sourceforge.net/phpsysinfo/?lng=fr)

In version 1.5 we added template support.  Currently a number templates are
packaged with the distribution.  If you wish to change you template just edit
index.php and change "define('TEMPLATE_SET','classic');" to which ever
template you want to use by default.  Alternatively you can add pass the
template on the url w/ ?template=classic or ?template=aq .


If Something Borked:
---------------------

You did it wrong.  Yes, really.  This code is practically perfect in every way.
Just like Mary Poppins. ;)

But seriously, if you do find some system that this script breaks on, or some
ways in which this script could be improved, please email me at
phpsysinfo-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

if you don't feel like emailing me personally, submit a bug at

http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpsysinfo/

Since I'm one of the programmers at sourceforge, I tend to read it daily. ;-)
