****************************************************************
*** This script has been tested and works on linux 2.2/2.4,  ***
*** FreeBSD 4.x, OpenBSD 2.8+, NetBSD, Dawin/OSX             ***
****************************************************************


INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION:
  Please read the INSTALL file for installation instructions.


PLATFORM SPECIFIC:
  There is currently a bug in FreeBSD that if you boot your system up and drop
  to single user mode and then again back to multiuser the system removes
  /var/run/dmesg.boot.  This will cause phpsysinfo to fail.  A bug has already
  been reported to the FreeBSD team.  (PS, this may exist in other *BSDs also)


OTHER NOTES:
  As of version 1.1 we have added internationalization to phpSysInfo.  If you
  feel like doing a translation please send an email to one of us.  If you'd 
  like to see the i18n support in action look at ./includes/lang for the 
  language files.  Then just add a ?lang=$filename to your url.

  As of version 1.5 we have added templating support thanks to Joseph Engo! 
  If you wish to create new templates take a look in the templates/ directory.
  If you make a cool new one and think we should distribute it w/ the code
  email it to us.

  In version 1.9-2.0 we've got *bsd support thanks to many, many people.
  Hopes are to have {free,net,open}bsd support along w/ OSX by release.

  This code has grown and been distributed to places we never dreamed... 
  Now proudly sporting full i18n and templates!  If you wish to add a
  translation, or template please feel free to send it to us.  Also, if you
  have an unusual system, and the hardware doesn't parse out of /proc
  correctly, send us an email describing the problem  (AND the output of
  'cat /proc/<whatever>')
