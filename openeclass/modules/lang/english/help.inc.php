  <li>Questions on an unique page</li>
  <li>One question per page (sequential)</li>
</ul>
and tell if you want or not questions to be randomly sorted at the time of the exercise running.<br><br>
Then, save your exercise. You will go to to the question administration for this exercise.</p>

<b>Question adding</b>
<p>You can now add a question into the exercise previously created. The description is optional, as well as the
picture
 that you have the possibility of linking to your question.</p>

<b>Fill in the blanks</b>

<p>This allows you to create a text with gaps. The aim is to let student find words that you have removed from
the text.<br><br>
To remove a word from the text, and so to create a blank, put this word between brackets [like this].<br><br>
Once the text has been typed and blanks defined, you can add a comment that will be seen by the student when it
replies to the question.<br><br>
Save your text, and you will enter the next step that will allow you to give a weighting to each blank. For
example, if the question worths 10 points and you have 5 blanks, you can give a weighting of 2 points to each
blank.</p>
<hr>
<b>Matching</b>
<p>This answer type can be chosen so as to create a question where the student will have to connect elements from
an unit U1 with elements from an unit U2.<br><br>
It can also be used to ask students to sort elements in a certain order.<br><br>
First define the options among which the student will be able to choose the good answer. Then, define the
questions which will have to be linked to one of the options previously defined. Finally, connect via the drop-down menu
elements from the first unit with those of the second one.<br><br>
Notice: Several elements from the first unit can point to the same element in the second unit.<br><br>

order among all questions of the exercise.<br><br>
That means that, by enabling this option, questions will be drawn in a different order each time students will

<p><b>What is a Learning Path ?</b></p>

<p>A Learning Path is a sequence of learning steps included in modules. It can be
content-based (looking like a table of contents) or activities-based, looking like
an agenda or a programme of what you need to do in order to understand and practice a
certain knowledge or know-how.</p>

<p>In addition to being structured, a learning path can
also be sequenced. This means that some steps will constitute pre-requisites for the steps
after them (\"you cannot go to step 2 before step 1\"). Your sequence can only be suggestive
(you show steps one after the other).</p>

<p><b>How to create our own Learning Path ?</b></p>

<p>The first step is to arrive to Learning Path List section. In
the Learning Path List screen, there is a link to it. There you can create
many paths by clicking onto <i>Create a new learning path</i>. But they are
empty, till you add modules and steps to them.</p>

<p><b>What are the steps for these paths ? (What are the items that can be added ?)</b></p>

<p>Some of the Eclass tools, activities and contents that you consider to be useful
and connected to your imagined path can be added:</p>

<ul>
<li>Separate documents (texts, pictures, Office docs, ...)</li>
<li>Labels</li>
<li>Links</li>
<li>Eclass Tests</li>
<li>Eclass Course Description</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Other features of Learning Path</b></p>

<p>Students can be asked to follow (read) your path in a given order. This means
that for example students cannot go to Quiz 2 till they have read Document 1.
All items have a status: completed or incomplete, so the progress of students is
clearly available through the <i>Tracking</i> tool.</p>

<p>If you alter the original title of a step, the new title will appear in
the path, but the original title will not be deleted. So if you want
test8.doc to appear as 'Final Exam' in the path, you do not have to rename
the file, you can use the new title in the path. It is also useful
to give new titles to links as they are too long.</p>

<p><b>What is a Scorm or IMS format Learning path and how to upload (import) it ?</b></p>

<p>The learning path tool allows you to upload SCORM and IMS compliant course
contents.</p>

<p>SCORM (<i>Sharable Content Object Reference Model</i>) is a public standard
followed by major e-Learning actors like NETg, Macromedia, Microsoft, Skillsoft,
etc. and acting at three levels:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Economy</b>: Scorm allows whole courses or small content
units to be reusable on different Learning Management Systems (LMS)
through the separation of content and context,</li>
<li><b>Pedagogy</b>: Scorm integrates the notion of
pre-requisite or <i>sequencing</i> (<i>e.g. </i>\"You
cannot go to chapter 2 before passing Quiz 1\"),</li>
<li><b>Technology</b>: Scorm generates a table of contents as
an abstraction layer situated outside content and outside the LMS. It
helps content and LMS communicate with each
other. What is communicated is mainly <i>bookmarks</i> (\"Where is John in the
course ?\"), <i>scoring</i> (\"How did John pass the test ?\") and <i>time</i> (\"How much
time did John spent in chapter 1 ?\").</li>
</ul>

<p><b>How to create a SCORM compliant learning path ?</b></p>

<p>The most natural way is to use the Eclass Learning Path Builder. However, you may want to
create complete Scorm compliant websites locally on your own computer before uploading it
onto your eclass platform. In this case, we recommend the use of a sophisticated tool like
Lectora&reg; or Reload&reg;</p>

<p><b>Useful links</b></p>

<h4>Basic syntax</h4>
<p>Creating wiki pages and links between them</p>
<p><strong>Wiki words</strong>: Wiki words are words written like <em>WikiWord</em>. To create a wiki page or to create a link to a wiki page, edit an existing one and add the title of the page in WikiWord syntax, for example <em>MyPage</em>, then save the page. Automatically the Wiki Word <em>MyPage</em> will be replaced with a link to the Wiki page <em>MyPage</em>&nbsp;;</p>
<p><strong>Wiki links</strong> : Wiki links are like Hyperlinks (see below) except that they do not contain any protocol scheme (like <em>http://</em> or <em>ftp://</em>) and are automatically recognized as links to Wiki pages. To create a new page or create a link to an existing one using Wiki links, edit a page and add <code>[page title]</code> or <code>[name of link|title of page]</code> to its content. You can also use this syntax to change the text of a WikiWord link : <code>[name of link|WikiWord]</code>.</p>
<ul>Hyperlinks
<li><code>[url]</code>, <code>[name|url]</code>, <code>[name|url|language]</code> or <code>[name|url|language|title]</code>.&nbsp;;</li></ul>
<ul>Image inclusion
<li><code>((url|alternate text))</code>, <code>((url|alternate text|position))</code> or <code>((url|alternate text|position|long description))</code>. <br />The position argument can take the following values: L (left), R (right) or C (center). &nbsp;
You can use the syntax as Hyperlinks. For example <code>[title|image.gif]</code>. This syntax is deprecated, consider to use the preceding one &nbsp;</li></ul>
<ul>Link to an image
<li>same as Hyperlinks but put a 1 in fifth argument to avoid image recognition and get an hyperlink to an image. For example <code>[image|image.gif||0]</code> will display a link to image.gif instead of display the image itself</li></ul>
<p>Layout</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Italic</strong>: surround your text with two single quotes <code>\'\'text\'\'</code>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Bold</strong>: surround your text with three single quotes underscores <code>\'\'\'text\'\'\'</code>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Underline</strong>: surround your text with two underscores <code>__text__</code>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Stroke</strong>: surround your text with two minus symbols <code>--text--</code>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: <code>!!!</code>, <code>!!</code>, <code>!</code> respectively for titles, sub-titles and sub-sub-titles&nbsp;</li>
<li>List</li>
line starting with <code>*</code> (unordered list) or <code>#</code> (ordered list). You can mix lists (<code>*#*</code>) to create multi-level lists&nbsp;
<li>Paragraph</li>
Separate paragraphs with one or more new lines&nbsp;
</ul>

<h4>Advanced syntax</h4>
<ul>
<li>Footnote</li>
<code>$$ footnote text$$</code>&nbsp;
<li>Preformated text</li>
begin each line of preformated text with a blank space&nbsp;
<li>Cite block</li>
<code>&gt;</code> or <code>;:</code> before each line&nbsp;
<li>Horizontal line</li>
<code>----</code>&nbsp;
<li>Forced line break</li>
<code>%%%</code>&nbsp;
<li>Acronym</li>
<code>??acronym??</code> or <code>??acronym|definition??</code>&nbsp;
<li>Inline cite</li>
<code>{{cite}}</code>, <code>{{cite|language}}</code> or <code>{{cite|language|url}}</code>&nbsp;
</ul>
